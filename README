# Pomodoro Timer (Work in Progress)

This is a Pomodoro timer project focused on a modern, customizable, and responsive interface. The visual part is mostly complete, but the full timer functionality is still under development.

## Current Status

- Complete graphical interface with Pomodoro, short break, and long break modes  
- Time, color, and font settings available through a settings panel  
- Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices  
- Basic timer with animations (limited or pending full functionality)  

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, animations, media queries)  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events, class handling)  

---

## Next Steps / Pending Features

- Implement full timer logic and state management  
- Add sounds and notifications  
- Save settings in localStorage  
- Improve accessibility and cross-browser compatibility

## How to Try It Out

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Explore the interface and settings (note: the timer might not be fully functional yet)
